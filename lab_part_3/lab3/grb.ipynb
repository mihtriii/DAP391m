    "- AdaBoost was the first successful boosting algorithm [Freund et al., 1996, Freund and Schapire, 1997]\n",

    "- belongs to the group of algorithms called Arcing - Adaptive Reweighting and Combining algorithms\n",

    "#### Main idea\n",
    "- model is a combination of many \"weak learners\" - decision trees with a single split <B>(stumps)</B>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key features\n",
    "- puts more weight on difficult to classify instances and less on those already handled well\n",
    "- order of the stumps is important,error of the first stump influence on how the second stump is made\n",
    "- some stumps have the greater weights(votes) than the others\n",

    "2. A weak learner to make predictions.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function\n",
    "- depends on the type of problem being solved\n",

    "- regression may use a squared error and classification may use logarithmic loss\n",

    "#### Weak Learner\n",
    "- subsequent regression trees are used to correct the residuals in the predictions\n",
    "- regression trees have usually with 4-to-8 levels\n",
    "- possible parameters are  maximum number of layers,nodes, splits or leaf nodes\n",

    "\n",
    "#### When to use XGBoost?\n",
    "- When there is a larger number of training samples. Ideally, greater than 1000 training samples and less 100 features or we can say when the number of features < number of training samples.\n",
    "- When there is a mixture of categorical and numeric features or just numeric features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main idea \n",
    "- minimize the objective function\n",
    "- apply Taylor’s Theorem so can use objective (loss) function as a simple function of the new added learner \n",
    "- build a learner that achieves the maximum possible reduction of loss, \n",
    "- we can't enumerate all the possible tree structures so we must use \"Exact Greedy Algorithm\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to build the new learner\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with single root (contains all the training examples)\n",
    "- Iterate over all features and values per feature, and evaluate each possible split loss reduction:\n",
    "- gain = loss(father instances) - (loss(left branch)+loss(right branch))\n",
