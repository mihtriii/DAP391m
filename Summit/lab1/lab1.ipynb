    "- 1960's\n",
    "    - 1966: Hunt, colleagues in psychology used full search decision tree methods to model human concept learning\n",
    "- 1970’s\n",
    "    - 1977: Breiman, Friedman, colleagues in statistics developed simultaneously CART (Classification And Regression Trees) algorithm\n",
    "    - 1979: Quinlan’s first work with prototype of ID3 (based on information theory)\n",
    "- 1980’s\n",
    "    - 1984: first mass publication of CART software (now in many commercial codes)\n",
    "    - 1986: Quinlan’s landmark paper on ID3\n",
    "    - Variety of improvements: coping with noise, continuous attributes, missing data\n",
    "- 1990’s\n",
    "    - 1993: Quinlan’s updated algorithm, C4.5\n",
    "    - More pruning, overfitting control heuristics (C5.0, etc.)\n",
